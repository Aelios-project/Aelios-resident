// One Claude Code session for one turn of the resident's, through the official Claude Agent SDK signed in with the
// owner's own `claude setup-token` (kept on this machine, handed in by the box, never on the wire). The resident
// sends the whole conversation every turn, so a box that restarted carries on. A turn is
//   { model, system, effort?, thinking?, tools?, history, prompt }, and its reply goes back as lines:
//     { "e": <a streamed Messages API event of the reply> } …
//     { "done": { "prompt": [entries], "reply": [entries] } }   the transcript entries Claude Code wrote for the prompt and its reply
//     { "error": "…" }                                          instead of done when the turn failed
//
// history is the conversation before the prompt, in order. An item is either { entries } (what this box wrote for
// that message on an earlier turn, sent back untouched so the request Claude Code makes matches the one before and
// the prompt cache keeps hitting) or { role, content } (a message the box never saw, written into the transcript).
//
// tools are the resident's (Messages API tool definitions). Claude Code sees them through the box's loopback MCP
// server (local.mjs), and its calls wait there: the reply streams back with its tool_use blocks and ends, the
// resident runs the tools itself, and its next turn, whose prompt is their tool_result blocks, answers the waiting
// calls. The same Claude Code then goes on. A box that no longer has that Claude Code (it restarted, or waited too
// long) tells the calls and their results as text instead. Claude Code's own tools (commands, files, the web) stay
// off, and so do settings files and every other MCP server. That stripping is why this is the SDK and not an ACP
// adapter (see docs/claude-box.md).
